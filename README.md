## ABOUT:
This project is all about helping the students get a good understanding of the daily online lectures. QuizZen is an app where the teacher can create a room for uploading a quiz and the students present in that room will attempt the quiz. The teacher will not have to waste his time searching for questions on the quiz. He can simply upload a youtube link of a video and the quiz link will be sent to the students.
